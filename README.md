# nth_Digit_of_PI
find the nth digit of PI

my calc professor said it couldnt be done (as a series)

it only works to 19 digits at the moment

I believe i will need to create a new program to calculate pi, rather than import it from math.
I will try to calculate pi to baout the (n+3)th digit, as to minimize roundig errors
